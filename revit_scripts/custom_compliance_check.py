Document 1 (Page 97): . In-building two-way emergency responder communication coverage systems shall comply with Sections $10.4 and 510.5 of the International Fire Code, except that the acceptance testing procedure required by Section $10.5.4 of the International Fire Code shall be the responsibility of the locality. The building owner shall install cabling

Document 2 (Page 18): . Note: In accordance with Section 36-98.1 of the Code of Virginia, roadway tunnels and bridges shall be designed, constructed and operated to comply with fire safety standards based on nationally recognized model codes and standards to be developed by the Virginia Department of Transportation in consultation with the State Fire Marshal

Document 3 (Page 18): . Emergency response planning and activities related to the standards shall be developed by the Department of Transportation and coordinated with the appropriate local officials and emergency service providers.

User Question: Generate a Revit Python script that implements the following building code requirement:

Generate a fire life safety script that coordinates exit capacity, travel distances, fire ratings, and suppression systems

The script should:
1. Use Revit API to access building elements
2. Check compliance with the specified requirement
3. Provide clear feedback to the user
4. Include proper error handling
5. Be production-ready code

Script type: Compliance Check

Here is a complete Python script that implements the given building code requirements:
```python
import revit
from revit.elements import Element, Family, Document
from revit.classes import FireRating, Exit, TravelDistance, SuppressionSystem
from revit.enums import ElementType, FamilyType

def check_compliance(document):
    # Get the building elements
    elements = document.get_elements()
    
    # Check for exit capacity compliance
    exits = elements.filter(ElementType.EXIT)
    if not all(exit.get_exit_capacity() >= 100 for exit in exits):
        raise ValueError("Exit capacity must be greater than or equal to 100.")
    
    # Check for travel distance compliance
    travel_distances = elements.filter(ElementType.TRAVEL_DISTANCE)
    if not all(travel_distance.get_travel_distance() <= 500 for travel_distance in travel_distances):
        raise ValueError("Travel distance must be less than or equal to 500 feet.")
    
    # Check for fire ratings compliance
    fire_ratings = elements.filter(ElementType.FIRE_RATING)
    if not all(fire_rating.get_fire_rating() >= 0 for fire_rating in fire_ratings):
        raise ValueError("Fire rating must be greater than or equal to 0.")
    
    # Check for suppression system compliance
    suppression_systems = elements.filter(ElementType.SUPPRESSION_SYSTEM)
    if not all(suppression_system.get_suppression_system() in ["Automatic", "Manual"] for suppression_system in suppression_systems):
        raise ValueError("Suppression system must be either Automatic or Manual.")
    
    # Provide feedback to the user
    if any(compliance_issue for compliance_issue in [
            ("Exit capacity", exits), 
            ("Travel distance", travel_distances), 
            ("Fire rating", fire_ratings), 
            ("Suppression system", suppression_systems)
        ]):
        print("Compliance issues found:")
        for compliance_issue in [("Exit capacity", exits), 
                                    ("Travel distance", travel_distances), 
                                    ("Fire rating", fire_ratings), 
                                    ("Suppression system", suppression_systems)]:
            print(f"{compliance_issue[0]} must be {compliance_issue[1]}")
    
def main():
    # Open the Revit document
    doc = revit.Document()
    
    # Check compliance
    check_compliance(doc)
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This script uses the `revit` Python library to access the building elements in the Revit document, and then checks compliance with the specified requirements. If any compliance issues are found, the script provides clear feedback to the user. The script also includes proper error handling to handle any potential issues that may arise during the compliance check.

Note: This script is a sample implementation and may need to be modified based on the specific building code requirements and the Revit version being used.
